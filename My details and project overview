Overview of the Project
Project: Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the Titanic dataset.
Objective
The project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including their demographics, travel details, and survival status. The goal is to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the data to understand factors that contributed to survival.

Key steps include:

Data Cleaning and Exploration: Identifying missing values, understanding the structure, and summarizing the dataset.
Distribution Analysis: Visualizing the distributions of numerical features like age and fare using histograms to understand their spread.
Categorical Insights: Analyzing survival rates based on categorical features (e.g., gender, class) through count plots to see how these factors influenced survival.
Correlation Analysis: Using a heatmap to examine correlations between numerical features, identifying potential relationships.
Outlier Detection: Visualizing potential outliers in numerical data using boxplots.
Relationship Exploration: Exploring the relationships between features, particularly focusing on how they relate to survival through pairplots.
